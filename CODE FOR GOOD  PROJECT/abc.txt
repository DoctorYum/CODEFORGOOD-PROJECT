are established in the written language, being used by
good authors, or words in everyday conversational use,
should find a place in a dictionary, from whatever source
they may be derived. The lexicographer may deplore
the introduction of loan words, but he is bound to �
recognise their existence. Of course, words not well
established or not widely used, have not the same claim

given those loan words which have a footing in the
spoken or written language, especially when they have
acquired a new shade of meaning. In writing the
language, words only recently borrowed and for which
there are Irish equivalents, should be sparingly used.
It is otherwise with words that have already a life of a

borrows from other tongues, and it isa sign of health
and vigour when a language can assimilate a crop of
foreign words and reduce them to subjection by the
rigorous application of its own syntax and of its own
inflexional forms.

Want of space prevented my treating of the derivation
of the bulk of the words in the dictionary, or of tracing
their relationship to words in kindred tongues. It need

it bears to the Welsh and Breton languages a kinship
similar to that which exists between modern English
and modern German, that it is a development of a
language which was cognate to the earlier forms of the
great family of languages spoken and written in modern
Europe, that though its vocabulary has been consider-
ably influenced by Latin within historic times, and by.
English within the last three centuries, it has preserved
